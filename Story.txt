one day i ate A taco. It was very good. the taco was made by someone named Paul. Paul thinks that he loves tacos more than me. I proved Paul wrong by eating everything in his shop. He wont be eating tacos for a while. About a week went by and i felt bad so i went by his shop. I thought i was dreaming because it was now a burger shop. I walked inside and asked if they knew a guy named paul, but they all said they didn't. I went to every taco shop for weeks but paul seems to have dissapeared. I was about to give up looking for him when i smelled tacos. I started running towards the smell and got excited. I came up on a van by a river. It didnt look like a very safe place to be near but the only thing i could think about was the tacos. i opened the van door and was shocked! There was Paul lying dead covered in taco bell tacos. The moral of the story is to not eat Taco Bell.
