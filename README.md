This is just a short story my instructors had me put together so they could introduce me and the other classmates starting the journey through DevCodeCanp with to GitHub and the features that it has. First by creating a repository and explaning what it is and then second by seeing how we worked our way around the problems faced when we tried to commit and push our story into a classmates repo.
